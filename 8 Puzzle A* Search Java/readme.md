Solving the 8-puzzles problem using A* search, as taught in class and in lecture notes. (You may not use Java built-in linked list in this project!)
The three A* functions you used in this program are:
g(n) - # of moves from initial state to node/state n
h*(n) - the total distance for all tiles to move from node/state n to the goal state.
f*(n) - g(n) + h*(n)
Create a few pairs of 8-puzzel configurations to test your program first, then, run your program with the given two pairs of test data: first pair: data1 and data2; 2nd pair: data3 and data4
