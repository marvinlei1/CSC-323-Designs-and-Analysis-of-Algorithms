Given a connected undirected graph, G, using the Primâ€™s algorithm to construct the Minimum Spanning Tree of G.
Prim's algorithm uses two sets, setA and setB to construct a MST of G.
Initially, setA contains only one node (can be any node in G) and setB contains the rest of nodes.
You will run your program four (4) times, using 1, 4, 8, 12 on each run as the initial node in setA.
