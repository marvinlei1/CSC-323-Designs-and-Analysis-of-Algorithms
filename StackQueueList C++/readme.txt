Linked-list implementation of Stack, Queue, and ordered list (in ascending order).
The operations include insertion, deletion and print. 
The input file contains a list of pair {<op, data>} where op is either + or -, where + means insert, - means delete, and data is a positive integer. 
For example, + 20, means insert 20, -20 means delete 20.
Your program will construct a stack, then, a queue and then, an ordered list, all in linked list implementations.
Reading from the input pairs, your program will perform operations, given by the pairs, on the Stack.
Then, reading the same input pairs, your program will perform operations on a queue, then do the same on an ordered list.
** For Stack and Queue, the data after the '-' is not used.
